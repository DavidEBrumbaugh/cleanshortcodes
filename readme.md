# Shortcode Cleaner
I wrote this plugin because when you take Visual Composer out of a site, it leaves behind *a lot* of "orphaned short codes".  I found a content filter on the WP Repository (https://wordpress.org/plugins/remove-orphan-shortcodes/) that will **hide** unused shortcodes, but I needed one that would **clean all** the shortcodes Visual Composer left behind so the content could be realistically maintained.

This plugin *will* substantailly alter your database so back it up before you use it.  

After you upload and activate the plugin, go to the "Clean Shortcode" option on the *Tools* menu.  Follow the prompts on the screen.

If you aren't comfortable backing up your database, uploading strange plugins, etc.  Contact me on CodeMentor, I'll probably be able to help you.
